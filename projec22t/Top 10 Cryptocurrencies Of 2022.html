        A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that can circulate without the centralized authority of a bank or government. To date, there are 22,023 cryptocurrency projects out there that represent the entire $878 billion crypto market. </p>
       <h1> 1. Bitcoin (BTC)</h1>
       <img src="images/Bitcoin (BTC).jpg"alt= "" width ="150pxh" height="150px">

        Created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-bitcoin/"target="-blank">Bitcoin</a>" (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency. As with most cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/05/18/what-is-the-blockchain-and-why-does-it-matter/"target="-blank"> blockchain</a> or a ledger logging transactions distributed across a network of thousands of computers. Because additions to the distributed ledgers must be verified by solving a cryptographic puzzle, a process called proof of work, Bitcoin is kept secure and safe from fraudsters.

        Bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed as it’s become a household name. In May 2016, you could buy one Bitcoin for about $500. As of Dec. 13, 2022, a single Bitcoin’s price was around $17,906. That’s a growth of 3,481%.

    </p>
    <h1>2. Ethereum (ETH)</h1>
    <img src="images/Ethereum (ETH).jpg"alt=""width="150pxh"height="150px">
    <h2><ul> <li>Market cap: $163.9 billion </li></ul></h2>
    <p>Both a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ethereum-ether/" target="_blank"> Ethereum </a> is a favorite of program developers because of its potential applications, like so-called smart contracts that automatically execute when conditions are met and non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/nft-non-fungible-token/"target="-blank">NFTs</a>). </p>
<p>Ethereum has also experienced tremendous growth. From April 2016 to the end of December 2022, its price went from about $11 to around $1,339, increasing 12,073%.</p>

<h1>3. Tether (USDT)</h1>
<img src="images/Tether (USDT).jpg"alt=""width="150pxh" height="150px">
<h2><ul> <li> Market cap: $65.8 billion</li></ul></h2>
<p>Unlike some other forms of cryptocurrency, Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro and hypothetically keeps a value equal to one of those denominations. In theory, this means Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other cryptocurrencies, and it’s favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins.</p>
<h1>4. Binance Coin (BNB)</h1>
<img src="images/Binance Coin (BNB).jpg" alt=""width="150pxh"height="150px">
<h2> <ul><li>Market cap: $44.8 billion</li></ul></h2>
<p>Binance Coin (BNB) is a form of cryptocurrency that you can use to trade and pay fees on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/binance-us-review/"target="-blank">Binance</a>, one of the largest <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-exchanges/"target="-blank">crypto exchanges</a> in the world. Since its launch in 2017, Binance Coin has expanded past merely facilitating trades on Binance’s exchange platform. Now, it can be used for trading, payment processing or even booking travel arrangements. It can also be traded or exchanged for other forms of cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin.</p>
<p>BNB’s price in 2017 was just $0.10. By late December 2022, its price had risen to around $280, a gain of 279,900%.</p>

   <h1>5. U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC)</h1>
   <img src="images/U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC).jpg" alt=""width="150pxh"height="150px">
   <h2><ul><li>Market cap: $42.6 billion</li></ul></h2>
   <p>Like Tether, USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by U.S. dollars and aims for a 1 USD to 1 USDC ratio. USDC is powered by Ethereum, and you can use USD Coin to complete global transactions.</p>
   <h1>6. Binance USD (BUSD)</h1>
   <img src="images/6. Binance USD (BUSD)s.jpg"alt=""width="150pxh"height="150px">
   <h2><ul><li>Market cap: $21.85 billion</li></ul></h2>
   <p>Binance USD (BUSD) is a stablecoin that Paxos and Binance founded to create a cryptocurrency backed by the U.S. dollar. To maintain this value, Paxos holds an amount of U.S. dollars equal to the total supply of BUSD. As with other stablecoins, BUSD gives traders and crypto users the ability to engage in transactions with other crypto assets while minimizing the risk of volatility.</p>
<h1>7. XRP (XRP)</h1>
<img src="images/7. XRP (XRP)n.jpg" alt=""width="150pxh"height="150px">
<h2><ul><li>Market cap: $19.8 billion</li></ul></h2>
<p>Created by some of the same founders as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ripple-xrp/"target="-blank">Ripple</a>, a digital technology and payment processing company, XRP can be used on that network to facilitate exchanges of different currency types, including fiat currencies and other major cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2017, the price of XRP was $0.006. As of Dec. 13, 2022, its price reached $0.39, equal to a rise of 6,400%.</p>
<h1>8. Dogecoin (DOGE)</h1>
<img src="images/8. Dogecoin (DOGE).jpg" alt=""width="150pxh"height="150px">
<h2><ul><li>Market cap: $12.46 billion</li></ul></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-dogecoin/"target="-blank">Dogecoin </a> was famously started as a joke in 2013 but rapidly evolved into a prominent cryptocurrency thanks to a dedicated community and creative memes. Unlike many other cryptos, there is no limit on the number of Dogecoins that can be created, which leaves the currency susceptible to devaluation as supply increases.</p>
<p>Dogecoin’s price in 2017 was $0.0002. By December 2022, its price was at $0.09, up 44,900%.</p>
<h1>9. Cardano (ADA)</h1>
<img src="images/9. Cardano (ADA).jpg" alt=""width="150pxh"height="150px">
<h2><ul><li>Market cap: $10.9 billion</li></ul></h2>
<p>Somewhat later to the crypto scene, Cardano (ADA) is notable for its early embrace of proof-of-stake validation. This method expedites transaction time and decreases energy usage and environmental impact by removing the competitive, problem-solving aspect of transaction verification in platforms like Bitcoin. Cardano also works like Ethereum to enable smart contracts and decentralized applications, which ADA, its native coin, powers.</p>
<p>Cardano’s ADA token has had relatively modest growth compared to other major crypto coins. In 2017, ADA’s price was $0.02. As of Dec. 13, 2022, its price was $0.32. This is an increase of 1,500%.</p>
<h1>10. Polygon (MATIC)</h1>
<img src="images/Polygon (MATIC).jpg" alt=""width="150pxh"height="150px">
<h2><ul><li>Market cap: $8.2 billion</li></ul></h2>
<p>Founded in 2017, Polygon—formerly known as Matic Network—is a relatively popular crypto. It’s dubbed “Ethereum’s internet of blockchains.” Maybe that’s why MATIC supports more than 7,000 decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p>Polygon has also experienced tremendous growth since its first launch. The initial price of MATIC when it first launched was $0.00263. Today MATIC trades at $0.94, a 35,641% gain.</p>
