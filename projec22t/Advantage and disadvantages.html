<h2><li><FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="5" COLOR="#800000"> Faster payment .</FONT> </li></h2> </FONT></li></h3> <FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="4">Using digital currency,you can complete payments
much faster than current means, like ACH or wire transfers,</br> which can take days for
financial institutions to confirm a transaction.</FONT>

<h3><li><FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="5" COLOR="#800000">Cheaper international transfers .</FONT></li></h3> <FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="4">International currency transactions 
are very expensive. individuals are charged high fees to move funds from </br>
one country to another , especially when it involves currency conversions.Digital assets could </br>
disrupt this market by making it faster and less costly</FONT>

<h4><li><FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="5" COLOR="#800000">24/7 access .</FONT></li></h4> <FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="4">Existing money transfers often take more time during weekends and outside
normal bussiness hours because banks are closed and </br> can<sup>,</sup>t confirm transactions.With digital
currency,transactions work at the same speed 24 hours a day,seven days a week.</FONT>

<h5><li><FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="5" COLOR="#800000">Support for the unbanked and underbanked .</FONT></li></h5> <FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="4">More than 7 million American households do not 
have a bank account,according to the FDIC in a 2019 survey. the end up paying </br>costly fees to cash their paychecks</br>
and send payments to others through money orders or remittances. If the country launched a CBDC, unbanked</br>
individuals could access their money and pay their bills without extra charges.</FONT>

<h6><li><FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="5" COLOR="#800000">More efficient government payments.</FONT></li></h6>
<FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="4">If the government developed a CBDC, it could send payments liketax refunds</br>

<h1><FONT FACE="Impact" SIZE="6" COLOR="#FF0000">Disadvantages of Digital Currency</FONT> </h1>

<h2><li><FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="5" COLOR="#800000"> Too many options .</FONT> </li></h2>
<FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="4">The current popularity of cryptocurrency is a downside."There are so many digital curriencies being created across </br>
different blockchains that aii have their own limitations. it will take time to determine which digital currencies may be appropriate for certain use cases,</br>
including whether some are designed to scale for mass adoption," Tessler says.</FONT> 

<h3><li><FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="5" COLOR="#800000">Steep learning curve</FONT> </li></h3>
<FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="4">Digital currencies require work on the part of the user to learn how to perform fundamental tasks,like how to open adigital wallet </br>
and properly store digital assets securely.The system needs to get simpler for digital currencies to be more widely adopted.</FONT>

<h4><li><FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="5" COLOR="#800000"> Expensive transaction.</FONT> </li></h4>   
<FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="4">Cryptocurrencies use blockchain,where computers must solve complex equations to verify and record transactions.this takes considerable electricity</br>
and gets more expensive as there are more transactions.. However, this would probably not exist for CBDC since the central bank would likely control it and</br>
complex consensus processes are not needed.</FONT>


<h5><li><FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="5" COLOR="#800000">Price volatility.</FONT> </li></h5>
<FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="4">Cryptocurrency prices and values can change suddenly. Cunha believes this is why businesses </br>
are reluctant to use it as a medium of exchange. “As a business, do I want to accept something volatile? What if I </br>
hold a Bitcoin for a week and it loses 20% of its value?” With CBDC, though, the value is much stabler, like </br>
paper currency, and cannot fluctuate like this.</FONT>


<h6><li><FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="5" COLOR="#800000">Slow progress.</FONT> </li></h6>
<FONT FACE=""Times New Roman"" SIZE="4"> A U.S. CBDC is still hypothetical, and if the government decides to create one, there will be </br>
costs associated with its development.</FONT>
